"""The reference CSTR on its own: three states, constant volume, one reaction A -> B.

The model is `units.cstr.rhs_constant_volume`, the constant-volume model of Romagnoli and
Palazoglu (2020), with its four external
quantities made inputs so that they can be manipulated or disturbed:

    F0   feed flow, m3/min            CA0  feed concentration, kmol/m3
    T0   feed temperature, K          Fj   jacket coolant flow, m3/min

State vector: [C_A kmol/m3, T K, T_j K].  The reactor has three steady states at the
reference parameters; the design point is the middle one, which is open-loop unstable,
unless another branch is asked for.
