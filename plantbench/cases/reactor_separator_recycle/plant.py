"""Reactor / column / recycle flowsheet built on the reference CSTR.

The reactor is the non-isothermal CSTR of Romagnoli and Palazoglu (2020).

Fresh feed, containing reactant A and a light inert I, joins the recycle and enters the
CSTR, where A -> B runs first-order and exothermic against a cooling jacket.  The
reactor effluent feeds a distillation column.  The inert and the unreacted reactant
leave overhead; the distillate is split into a recycle returning to the reactor and a
purge; the product B leaves as bottoms.

The flowsheet is designed so that the reactor sits exactly on the reference operating
point: the mixed reactor inlet carries C_A0 = 5 kmol/m3 at F0 = 3.2 m3/min and
T0 = 336.97 K, which reproduces C_A = 2.356 kmol/m3, T = 362.4 K, T_j = 345.8 K, and
with them the open-loop instability of the reference reactor.  Everything
established about the reactor on its own therefore carries over unchanged, and the
question this example asks is what closing a recycle around it does.

State vector, length 6 + column states:

    0        V        reactor liquid volume, m3
    1:4      C        reactor concentrations [I, A, B], kmol/m3
    4        T        reactor temperature, K
    5        T_j      jacket temperature, K
    6:       column   see `column.unpack`

Pressure is not a state.  Constant molar overflow presumes the column pressure loop is
perfect, which removes one degree of freedom from the plantwide problem; the reader
should count nine, not ten.

    """Design the flowsheet around the reference reactor operating point.

    The reactor inlet is pinned to `C_A0 = 5 kmol/m3` at `F0 = 3.2 m3/min`, so the
    reactor states are the reference's and the conversion, and with it the rate at which
    reactant must be fed and product withdrawn, are fixed before the separation is
    considered at all.

    Two unknowns remain, the reflux and the recycle flow, and two balances close them:

      * the product B entering the reactor arrives only in the recycle
      * the inert fed must equal the inert purged plus the inert lost in the bottoms

    The product balance, product made against product leaving in the purge and the
    bottoms, follows from the first of these and the column's own product balance, so it
    determines nothing and is reported as a check.  The reactant balance closes
    identically for the same reason: the mixer and the column balances force it.

    `V_boil` sets the separation quality, `z_inert` the inert content of the fresh feed,
    and `C_I0` the inert level at the reactor inlet, which is equivalent to choosing the
    purge.  All three are design choices rather than consequences.  Before `C_I0` was a
    specification the product balance stood in its place, and the inert level was then
    left to the solver's path.

    The reflux drum and column base inventories are free in the same way: the column
    fixes the distillate and bottoms flows, so no steady-state balance involves either
    holdup, and a solve leaves them wherever its path ends.  They are set after the solve,
    the drum to the column's nominal `drum_holdup` and the base to `base_holdup`.
