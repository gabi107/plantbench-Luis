"""`reactor_separator_recycle` as a `Case`: a reactor-separator-recycle plant with heat integration.

The reference
configuration, `CASE.config()`, is the base plant under the reference structure
(`effluent fixed + cascade`).  The `network` option selects one of the heat-integrated
plants of the design comparison instead, and `pump_around_share` moves D4 along the trade between heat
recovery and jacket authority.  Nothing here changes the model: every option selects
something the study scripts already build, so the reference results are untouched.
