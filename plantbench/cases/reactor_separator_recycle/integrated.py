"""Stage 2 plants: the base plant with a heat-exchanger network inside its loops.

Each design's exchangers are sized at the design operating point (`hen.design`) and
rated continuously as the plant moves (`hen.rate_exchangers`).  Three things connect the
network to the plant:

  * the reactor inlet temperature is no longer fixed.  Fresh feed and recycle mix at a
    temperature set by the reflux drum, the preheat exchangers raise it, and a trim
    heater under temperature control makes up the difference.  The trim can go negative,
    which stands for bypassing the preheat exchangers, so one loop covers both
    directions;
  * heat recovered in the reboiler reduces the steam the tray temperature loop has to
    ask for.  If recovered heat exceeds the demand, boil-up exceeds it until the bypass
    acts;
  * a reactor pump-around to the reboiler removes heat from the reactor alongside the
    jacket, so the column's bottoms temperature enters the reactor energy balance.

Exchanger duties follow their rated values through a first-order lag, which stands for
wall and fluid holdup and also keeps the model free of algebraic loops.  The column feed
is taken to be conditioned to its bubble point by a fast trim exchanger, so the column
sees a saturated liquid feed in every design.

The base-case design D1 is modeled the same way, with a trim heater carrying the whole
preheat duty, so that designs are compared with the same feed-temperature control.  The
§19.1-19.3 results use the base plant, where the reactor inlet temperature is simply held.
