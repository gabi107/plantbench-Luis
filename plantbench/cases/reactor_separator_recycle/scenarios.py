"""The control structures compared in the example, and the disturbances applied.

The structures differ in the decisions of Step 6 of the plantwide procedure of Luyben et al. (1998) -- whether a flow is fixed in the
recycle loop, and which one -- and in whether the reactor conditions move with the
throughput.  The column is controlled the same way in every structure where the choice
exists: a stripping-section tray temperature on the boil-up, with the reflux ratioed to
the column feed.  The comparison therefore isolates the recycle-loop decisions.

The reference structure is `plantwide`: the reactor effluent flow is fixed and sets
the production rate, the fresh feed holds the reactor level, and a composition
controller moves the reactor temperature set-point.
