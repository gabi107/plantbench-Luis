"""Dataset specifications: which configurations of a case to run, and how.

A specification is a TOML file with these tables:

    [study]      name, case, seed
    [base]       a configuration, as in `core.case.Config`
    [[variants]] optional partial configurations, each merged into the base in turn; or
    [variants]   named groups of them, `plant = [...]`, `upset = [...]`, whose Cartesian
                 product is taken, one member of each group merged in the order given
    [sweep]      dotted path -> list of values; the Cartesian product is taken
    [sample]     n, and dotted path -> [low, high]; a Latin hypercube of n points is drawn
                 for every combination of variant and sweep point
    [run]        t_end, dt, wall_budget, features, and states (false to store only the
                 inputs and measurements of each run, not its full state)

Dotted paths address a configuration section and then its keys, so that
`"tuning.reactor T.Kc"` is the gain of the loop named "reactor T" and
`"params.reactor.U"` is the parameter override whose key is "reactor.U".  A path may also
name a whole section, `"disturbance"`, with whole sections as its values.

`expand` turns a specification into the list of configurations it describes.  It is
deterministic in the seed, so the same file always describes the same runs.

A specification is named by a digest of its canonical text, and reported with a prefix that
says which text was hashed: `pb-spec:6a6fc673261b` names the runs, the specification
without its task, and `pb-protocol:dab0d47475e9` the specification with its task.  The
prefix keeps a digest from being read as a commit.
