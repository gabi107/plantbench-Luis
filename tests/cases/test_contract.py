"""The contract every case keeps, checked for every registered case.

The checks are `plantbench.contract.CHECKS`, shipped with the library so that a case
developed in its own package runs the same ones.  A case that fails here is a defect in
the case or in the interface.  If the interface is at fault, fix it in core rather than
special-casing the plant.
